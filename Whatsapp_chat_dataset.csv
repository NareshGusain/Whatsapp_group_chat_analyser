9845,04/01/2023, I noticed some issues with GitHub from few days . Initially i ignored it. But then yesterday i was trying to download a package by wget from a GitHub raw  link http://raw.githubusercontent.com (something like this)But no packets were received something was blocking the transfer. Then i found out that recently in India the GitHub content domains are blocked for some users 🤔 meaning they can't view the GitHub raw link . I investigated it further. I found many people have broken readmes as a result because they fetch content using GitHub raw user content link hence their readmes are broken 🙃 see if yours is also broken Here is what I found on news about the issue 👇🏻https://www.fizerkhan.com/blog/posts/github-is-blocked-in-india https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34231553,"Prathik Shetty (GDSC)', 'https', 'https"

13778,26/03/2023, you all read it,Prathik Shetty (GDSC)
13779,26/03/2023," Yo, it's Lurid, feeling kinda bleak,Got two exams to take, my future's looking bleak.Cryptography and system security,System programming and compiler design,Can't stop thinking about the sleep I'm about to decline.My brain's fried, my heart is weak,My eyes are droopy, can't even speak.But I gotta keep going, gotta stay strong,Or else my grades will be gone before long.I'm feeling like a meme, all alone and depressed,Stressed out and worried, can't even rest.But I gotta keep on studying, gotta keep on grinding,Otherwise, all my hard work will be binding.So wish me luck, and pray for my success,As I try to cram all this knowledge, I'll do my best.Cryptography and system security, system programming and compiler design,Lurid's gotta pass, gotta make it out alive.I thought I could do it, thought I had the time,But now it's too late, can't even make a rhyme.My mind is blank, can't remember a thing,Feeling hopeless and defeated, like a broken wing.I should have started sooner, should have planned ahead,Now all I can do is lay here in my bed.Feeling like a failure, can't even make the grade,My future's looking bleak, like a dark and stormy shade.But wait, what's this? A sudden spark of hope,I remember a trick, something I learned to cope.I channeled my inner ""sussus amogus"", and took a shot,Used all my wits and skills, gave it all I got.And to my surprise, I aced the test,Got full marks, I was the best.Cryptography and system security, system programming and compiler design,Lurid made it through, against all odds and time.So never give up, and always believe,In yourself and your abilities, you can always achieve.Even when the road seems dark and drear,You can shine bright, and conquer your fear.",Dhiraj Chauhan

15177,16/05/2023," Dear GDSC TCET Team,As I sit down to pen this message, a rush of memories from our journey together fills my heart. Over the course of our tenure, we've experienced a fascinating voyage of discovery, growth, and triumphs. From our first steps to our monumental achievements, each moment has been a testament to our spirit, dedication, and the power of teamwork. As we stand on the cusp of our final event together, it's hard not to feel a sense of nostalgia mingled with a bittersweet farewell.Tomorrow, we come together one last time, not just as a team but as a family. A family that has seen the highs and lows, stuck together through thick and thin, laughed together, learned together, and most importantly, grew together. We've been through the gruelling late nights, the seemingly impossible deadlines, and the moments of doubt and challenge. But we stood tall, and we prevailed, because that's who we are.I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to each one of you. You are the lifeblood of this team, and each of your contributions, big or small, has been instrumental in shaping our collective journey. I want to thank you for your resilience, your unwavering dedication, and your infectious enthusiasm that has kept us all going. It has been an honor to guide you, to learn from you, and to work alongside you.As we approach our final event, let's remember what brought us together in the first place - our shared passion for technology, our commitment to learning, and our desire to make a difference. Let's make this event not just a culmination of our tenure, but a celebration of all that we have achieved together. Let's make it big, let's make it memorable, let's make it a testament to our journey.This might be the end of our tenure, but it's not the end of our journey. The bonds we've forged, the lessons we've learned, and the memories we've created will always be a part of us. The friendships we've formed, the challenges we've overcome, the successes we've celebrated, they have all prepared us for the next stages of our lives.As we part ways, remember this, GDSC TCET is not just about the events we've held or the projects we've completed. It's about the spirit of collaboration, the pursuit of knowledge, and the bonds of friendship. It's about the difference we've made and the lives we've touched.Let's carry this spirit forward in our individual journeys. Let's continue to learn, grow, and strive for excellence. And no matter where we find ourselves in the future, let's always remember the time we spent together, the impact we made, and the family we formed.Here's to one last hurrah, to a grand finale, to a beautiful ending of this chapter, and to the beginning of many more. Let's make tomorrow not just an event, but a beautiful memory that we will carry in our hearts forever.With deepest affection and utmost gratitude,Dhiraj ChauhanAdvisory, GDSC TCET",Dhiraj Chauhan

15806,18/07/2023, what do you mean?,Dhiraj Chauhan
15807,18/07/2023," SE are allowed to register for working committee, and te for extended core and core.So how shall we differentiate them in Google forms?",Vansh Baghel
15808,18/07/2023, So that se students cannot apply for any core positions,Vansh Baghel
15809,18/07/2023, Make separate forms,Wilfred Almeida(Gdsc)
15810,18/07/2023, You can differentiate based on their answer like se te,Anam Ansari
15811,18/07/2023, Create a new section,Anam Ansari
15812,18/07/2023, Google,Anam Ansari
15813,18/07/2023, Use any other form provider that's let you add such logic,Wilfred Almeida(Gdsc)
15814,18/07/2023, They could still select core being se na,Vansh Baghel
15815,18/07/2023," Umm, I'll see to it",Vansh Baghel
15816,19/07/2023, then their problem 🤷‍♂️,Dhiraj Chauhan
15817,19/07/2023, you will eventually do know anyways,Dhiraj Chauhan
15818,19/07/2023," people say random shzz in job applications, that doesn’t mean you accept them",Dhiraj Chauhan
15819,19/07/2023, Makes sense,Vansh Baghel
15820,19/07/2023," So we will not make any field marked as required for selecting the positions, and this would work",Vansh Baghel
15821,19/07/2023, you should keep the position they want to apply for but mention that SE can only choose working committee while TE will be for core,Dhiraj Chauhan
15822,19/07/2023, based on classes show next page,Dhiraj Chauhan
15823,19/07/2023, and if some mismatch well lead the discussion and get it over with,Dhiraj Chauhan
15824,19/07/2023, Could we decide the next page based on their SE or TE selection?,Vansh Baghel
15825,19/07/2023, yes,Dhiraj Chauhan
15826,19/07/2023, and yea,Dhiraj Chauhan

15838,19/07/2023, @919769990750 what's ur reason this?,Vansh Baghel
15839,19/07/2023, To include for SE this time. Last year we couldn’t do proper recruitment as we were still setting up the structure,Anam Ansari
