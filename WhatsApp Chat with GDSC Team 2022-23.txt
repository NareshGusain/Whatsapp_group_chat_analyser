We can put riddles or quizzes related to programming problems or some opportunities for them and ask them to write answers in comment, because like this, more people will follow our page as it will be beneficial for them only as they are learning something new, and reach will also increase.

Also, facts can also be added regarding the new technologies and career options and we can help them to discover these things via posts (but without making it boring), as   this is the most needed in engineering
06/09/2022, 7:56 pm - Hrishikesh Yadav(GDSC): Yup will do, we will be sharing the short trick decks and other resources...

Have a thought for a design or a structure for an Instagram page?

11/10/2022, 6:33 pm - Wilfred Almeida(Gdsc): You know I was of the same mentality. I never thought of anything except studies. But looking back it feels like I forgot to live life. The rat race is never going to end and if you don't live out moments like this you might regret it later. Along with studies try to focus on making some good memories cuz down the line that's what will make smile. The leetcode submission won't.

With the new week, we're here with the new task for the week! 

This is the duty of the whole team to create the hype and increase the reach for GDSC-TCET and this is how we'll do it.

Get minimum of 5 followers to the Instagram page of GDSC-TCET, and mention their Instagram accounts in the following sheet:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wM2JcI5A3cs9RxZlKOcaEGxlpmoRbtBb8coS7lMq2bk/edit?usp=drivesdk

Make sure that you don't cheat by rewriting the id of the people who are already following, as we have the count already😌

Also, don't make people follow the page just for filling the sheet, we're doing this for consistent followers, so keep in mind that we'll have data of each team member in the sheet!!

30/10/2022, 8:18 pm - Anam Ansari: Like summary and what you learned
30/10/2022, 8:19 pm - Vansh Baghel: lol , to make that i would require a shortt summary of what happened 🤡
30/10/2022, 8:19 pm - +91 96532 96937: its fine then, you should not do it I believe
30/10/2022, 8:20 pm - +91 96532 96937: Do it when you want to share something you learned in a detailed way
30/10/2022, 8:20 pm - Vansh Baghel: correct 👀👀
30/10/2022, 8:20 pm - Vansh Baghel: and i believe that blogs must be written with interest
30/10/2022, 8:21 pm - Vansh Baghel: because it must contain deep knowledge of the topic to convey the same
30/10/2022, 8:21 pm - +91 96532 96937: not always deep knowledge...
30/10/2022, 8:21 pm - Hrishikesh Yadav(GDSC): So, that it would also add on a value or helpful for others too
30/10/2022, 8:21 pm - Vansh Baghel: here i dont mean that i m not interested , hope the message was clear
30/10/2022, 8:22 pm - Wilfred Almeida(Gdsc): U do anything like that and Dheeraj will come in your dreams

30/10/2022, 8:22 pm - Vansh Baghel: lmao
30/10/2022, 8:22 pm - +91 96532 96937: you dont need a deep knowledge to speak/convey about something
30/10/2022, 8:23 pm - +91 96532 96937: that might refrain you to speak about something somewhere
30/10/2022, 8:23 pm - Vansh Baghel: thats true na
30/10/2022, 8:24 pm - Vansh Baghel: in this way , we can share whatever small knowledge we have
30/10/2022, 8:24 pm - +91 96532 96937: what, we are saying same thing
30/10/2022, 8:24 pm - +91 96532 96937: lol
30/10/2022, 8:24 pm - +91 96532 96937: i meant here that you do not always need deep knowledge
30/10/2022, 8:25 pm - Vansh Baghel: but it'll be embarrassing ki while teaching someone asks you about something and udk
30/10/2022, 8:25 pm - +91 96532 96937: which is okay i guess (not sure about embarrassing -> its on an individiual how they take it)
30/10/2022, 8:25 pm - Vansh Baghel: u must know ig
30/10/2022, 8:25 pm - Wilfred Almeida(Gdsc): That's fine, you cannot know everything, just say idk, will get back 2 u
30/10/2022, 8:26 pm - Vansh Baghel: haan thats true

30/10/2022, 8:26 pm - Vansh Baghel: how would u take that?
30/10/2022, 8:26 pm - Vansh Baghel: like about the topic which you are teaching to the folks \
30/10/2022, 8:26 pm - Vansh Baghel: right!! 😮
30/10/2022, 8:26 pm - +91 96532 96937: if I would have attended and then I would utilized that knowledge to share something on twitter, linkedin for my own good
30/10/2022, 8:27 pm - +91 96532 96937: not always, while yes I would like myself to know at least about the stuff I am going to teach,

I will not be going out there to teach something that I have completely no idea
30/10/2022, 8:27 pm - +91 96532 96937: while you can talk about something new you have less idea of
30/10/2022, 8:28 pm - +91 96532 96937: like talking of basics of html after learning about them
30/10/2022, 8:28 pm - +91 96532 96937: and the same you can even teach
30/10/2022, 8:28 pm - +91 96532 96937: as long as you are confident about teaching
30/10/2022, 8:28 pm - +91 96532 96937: I should prolly go study
30/10/2022, 8:30 pm - +91 96532 96937: the same goes with blog -> you can do your twitter thread to a blog🤷🏾‍♂️
30/10/2022, 8:30 pm - Wilfred Almeida(Gdsc): I admitted yesterday that I haven't mastered postman and I still don't know abt a lot of stuff in there cuz I've never had the opportunity ti try stuff
30/10/2022, 8:30 pm - Wilfred Almeida(Gdsc): And it's fine

31/10/2022, 12:12 pm - Hrishikesh Yadav(GDSC): *Machine learning is a hot topic in 2022* 🔥

But do you know that a lot of companies are migrating from the traditional machine learning techniques to AutoML 🤔

Yes it will blow your mind 🤯 . But in industry sectors the use of ML is been streamlined and thus we need to adapt these changes💯

In this live stream i will be breaking down a case study on such a growing AutoML company that is transforming the future of ML💡

01/11/2022, 8:28 pm - Anam Ansari: Also today it was pointed out by @919653296937 that our own team members do not initiate a converstation in GDSC Groups.

Now even i am guilty of that. So if you all get any acheivements or anything to discuss which is related to technical, start a conversation in GDSC groups.
Example: Maitri can talk about the blog she wrote

The reason being, students are hesitant to talk as no one is talking. But if they see others it might help them 🙌

11/11/2022, 10:21 am - Sakshi(GDSC): Hello everyone!!

With the new week, we're here with the (older) task for the week! 

This is the duty of the whole team to create the hype and increase the reach for GDSC-TCET and this is how we'll do it. Well this is peak time to do this because we'll be doing team announcement soon and you must have enough reach to promote yourself!

Get minimum of 5 followers to the Instagram page of GDSC-TCET, and mention their Instagram accounts in the following sheet:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wM2JcI5A3cs9RxZlKOcaEGxlpmoRbtBb8coS7lMq2bk/edit?usp=drivesdk

Make sure that you don't cheat by rewriting the id of the people who are already following, as we have the count already😌

Also, don't make people follow the page just for filling the sheet, we're doing this for consistent followers, so keep in mind that we'll have data of each team member in the sheet!!

*This task is supposed to be done ASAP*

So, All the best!✨

11/11/2022, 11:30 pm - Anam Ansari: So recently Whatsapp released a new feature "Community" where you can club some groups together. 

*And this is what we tried to do for GDSC-TCET, where we clubbed all the existing groups, now this was done so that we can have a common annoucement channel.*

But it created a little confusion and also few members didnt have updated version, so everything went to chaos.😬
Thatswhy we deactivated the community for now, everything is back to normal!

Choose faculty 
-> 
Take their permission
-> 
Print, sign and give the LoR consent form to Foram shah maam(HoC coordinator for COMP) 
->
Draft the LoRs 
-> 
Show the drafts to your chosen faulty members and make changes as requested 
-> 
Get the draft printed and signed by the faculty 
-> 
Take the draft to TnP cell and get their sign 
-> 
Take the draft to HoC cell and get their sign 
-> 
Take the drafts to Office no 1 and pay him money for LoR and get the receipt 
-> 
Take the drafts and receipts to HoC and get it printed on offical paper
 -> 
get the offical LoRs signed by faculty 
-> 
Get the official LoRs stamped by the office no1.
-> Congratulations you have your LoRs
22/12/2022, 10:17 am - Prathik Shetty (GDSC): Why you need LOR from your college?
22/12/2022, 10:18 am - +91 96532 96937: oh î remember LOR for stuff
22/12/2022, 10:19 am - Prathik Shetty (GDSC): How much months will it take

22/12/2022, 10:21 am - Prathik Shetty (GDSC): AIML is clueless 😬

Here people don't know about these stuff. Even we are too behind in Aicte points collection etc 

Our students don't participate much in activities ig
22/12/2022, 10:31 am - Wilfred Almeida(Gdsc): I got 0 in aicte points😂
22/12/2022, 10:33 am - Närësh: Whats the worst thing can happen
If someone fail to collect 100 points in 4 year
22/12/2022, 10:34 am - Wilfred Almeida(Gdsc): Let me find out and I'll let you know
22/12/2022, 10:35 am - Närësh: Sure😂♥️
22/12/2022, 10:36 am - +91 96532 96937: wont get degree

22/12/2022, 10:36 am - +91 96532 96937: you need 100 points in 4 years
22/12/2022, 10:37 am - Närësh: <Media omitted>
22/12/2022, 10:37 am - +91 96532 96937: dw, college will do something about it
22/12/2022, 10:37 am - Prathik Shetty (GDSC): Also as you all are in second year you have great time by your side🚀

I would suggest some stuff that you can do👇🏻

1) participate in hackathons

2) join open source communities

3) create good profiles (twitter, linkedln, GitHub) for getting opportunities as recruiter might see it

4) do less projects but unique(just imo) . Also pls host them as one will find difficult to run it on localhost as install dependencies etc stuff

(Add points to this maybe)

25/12/2022, 2:52 pm - Hrishikesh Yadav(GDSC): *Have you ever heard of an application that can generate programming code for you?💭* 
You might think it's strange, but I'm referring to an application that can create code for you based on your programming questions. I used to call the application OpenCode and have given it more flexibility in application so that users can receive the most appropriate solution✨. 

I have posted a tutorial on how to create a basic streamlit application with OpenAI here: 

🔗https://medium.com/@hriskikesh.yadav332/how-to-make-a-streamlit-app-with-openai-5e63a8e0135b

The Project link, Demonstration and Step by step approach is present in blog. The project is based on the GPT descendant CodeX model. It would be great if you could like it if you found it useful.

04/01/2023, 11:26 am - Prathik Shetty (GDSC): I noticed some issues with GitHub from few days . Initially i ignored it. But then yesterday i was trying to download a package by wget from a GitHub raw  link http://raw.githubusercontent.com (something like this)

But no packets were received something was blocking the transfer. 

Then i found out that recently in India the GitHub content domains are blocked for some users 🤔 meaning they can't view the GitHub raw link . I investigated it further. I found many people have broken readmes as a result because they fetch content using GitHub raw user content link hence their readmes are broken 🙃 see if yours is also broken 

Here is what I found on news about the issue 👇🏻

17/01/2023, 10:28 pm - Anam Ansari changed this group's settings to allow only admins to send messages to this group
17/01/2023, 10:35 pm - Anam Ansari: I have been noticing that not all team members join the session.  Every session there are only few active members. Rest others don’t join. I don’t even get a reason now as why they are not joining.


I ignored it during cloud sessions as exams and act was going on

But today was not a hectic day. There are few members who are constantly absent, I won’t take name, but the team knows. 

If this continues you won’t get equal AICTCE points as I will be allocating them. For last sem I marked everyone present in all sessions but this it won’t be the case this time.
18/01/2023, 1:24 am - Hrishikesh Yadav(GDSC): Having inclusivity, openness, and enthusiasm in the community is always important to us. Previously, we did not force anyone to attend the meet, but there is a lack of team spirit. Please be active in the community and attend all the sessions from now onwards. There has been a record of all attendance. 

Do try to get involved yourself if any opportunity comes up to speak up in session, suggesting something, putting your own opinion, being enthusiastic about exploration, understanding the roles and responsibility for pre and post event tasks and many more. 

Please let us know if you are experiencing any issues or having any suggestions. The inclusivity and openness into the community makes it stronger.

05/02/2023, 12:24 pm - Hrishikesh Yadav(GDSC): *Are you interested in building a machine learning model and an analytical application 📱 but want to test out with minimal frontend first?*

When you're more concerned about functionality, *Streamlit is a great choice.*✅ Streamlit's frontend has some design constraints, but there are ways to make it look cool 🌟. I have written a blog on *"Setting the Cool Background on Streamlit Application".* This will allow you to understand how the components can be modified from the div✨

20/03/2023, 12:43 am - Wilfred Almeida(Gdsc): Mine finished, gotta write stuff
20/03/2023, 12:44 am - Prathik Shetty (GDSC): Write remedials
20/03/2023, 12:44 am - Wilfred Almeida(Gdsc): Remedials, fa and idk what else before isa💀
20/03/2023, 12:45 am - Wilfred Almeida(Gdsc): Ppl started studying for isa frm now🥹

Giving me anxeity
20/03/2023, 12:45 am - Prathik Shetty (GDSC): One night is all it takes
20/03/2023, 12:46 am - Wilfred Almeida(Gdsc): If u have sheets & answer pdfs. I need sheets, with my playlist, 2hrs is all I need
20/03/2023, 12:47 am - Prathik Shetty (GDSC): How about a 3D assignment writer AI robot @917900049987 that can train on your handwritten notes and can take input from others assignment and write it for you🙂
20/03/2023, 12:47 am - Prathik Shetty (GDSC): I want AI to take my place  and enjoy writing assignments
20/03/2023, 12:47 am - Wilfred Almeida(Gdsc): Great idea, make it. @919653296937 will fund it
20/03/2023, 1:07 am - Hrishikesh Yadav(GDSC): I have thought about this problem statement but there are many factors which we need to take into consideration. Each user needs to train the model as per there own handwriting dataset means we will be only providing custom model via app.
20/03/2023, 1:08 am - Hrishikesh Yadav(GDSC): There are some websites like handwriting.io which provides you the template of handwriting and then converts the digital text to hand written.
20/03/2023, 1:09 am - Prathik Shetty (GDSC): We can use transfer learning to accomplish this the new user can fine tune their data on the pretrained model maybe

2] People with Thorat cancer. 

But I am thinking to go with just Vowels as people with Throat Cancer can hardly speak


Then I am thinking to use various Fourier analysis methods to extract different data from theses voices like pitch, amplitude and many more parameters then buil a ML model to detect the voice of people with Throat Cancer 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️

26/03/2023, 6:53 pm - +91 96532 96937: Yo, it's Lurid, feeling kinda bleak,
Got two exams to take, my future's looking bleak.
Cryptography and system security,
System programming and compiler design,
Can't stop thinking about the sleep I'm about to decline.

My brain's fried, my heart is weak,
My eyes are droopy, can't even speak.
But I gotta keep going, gotta stay strong,
Or else my grades will be gone before long.

I'm feeling like a meme, all alone and depressed,
Stressed out and worried, can't even rest.
But I gotta keep on studying, gotta keep on grinding,
Otherwise, all my hard work will be binding.

So wish me luck, and pray for my success,
As I try to cram all this knowledge, I'll do my best.
Cryptography and system security, system programming and compiler design,
Lurid's gotta pass, gotta make it out alive.

I thought I could do it, thought I had the time,
But now it's too late, can't even make a rhyme.
My mind is blank, can't remember a thing,
Feeling hopeless and defeated, like a broken wing.

I should have started sooner, should have planned ahead,
Now all I can do is lay here in my bed.
Feeling like a failure, can't even make the grade,
My future's looking bleak, like a dark and stormy shade.

But wait, what's this? A sudden spark of hope,
I remember a trick, something I learned to cope.
I channeled my inner "sussus amogus", and took a shot,
Used all my wits and skills, gave it all I got.

And to my surprise, I aced the test,
Got full marks, I was the best.
Cryptography and system security, system programming and compiler design,
Lurid made it through, against all odds and time.

So never give up, and always believe,
In yourself and your abilities, you can always achieve.
Even when the road seems dark and drear,
You can shine bright, and conquer your fear.

While OTC drugs are sold without the need for a doctor's prescription, the FDA still sets extremely specific guidelines on how they're packaged.
03/05/2023, 6:55 pm - Kaushal (GDSC): Like we could keep pole on the WhatsApp group/insta asking them how excited they are or let them guess what's the next surprise??

16/05/2023, 6:31 pm - +91 96532 96937: Dear GDSC TCET Team,

As I sit down to pen this message, a rush of memories from our journey together fills my heart. Over the course of our tenure, we've experienced a fascinating voyage of discovery, growth, and triumphs. From our first steps to our monumental achievements, each moment has been a testament to our spirit, dedication, and the power of teamwork. As we stand on the cusp of our final event together, it's hard not to feel a sense of nostalgia mingled with a bittersweet farewell.

Tomorrow, we come together one last time, not just as a team but as a family. A family that has seen the highs and lows, stuck together through thick and thin, laughed together, learned together, and most importantly, grew together. We've been through the gruelling late nights, the seemingly impossible deadlines, and the moments of doubt and challenge. But we stood tall, and we prevailed, because that's who we are.

I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to each one of you. You are the lifeblood of this team, and each of your contributions, big or small, has been instrumental in shaping our collective journey. I want to thank you for your resilience, your unwavering dedication, and your infectious enthusiasm that has kept us all going. It has been an honor to guide you, to learn from you, and to work alongside you.

As we approach our final event, let's remember what brought us together in the first place - our shared passion for technology, our commitment to learning, and our desire to make a difference. Let's make this event not just a culmination of our tenure, but a celebration of all that we have achieved together. Let's make it big, let's make it memorable, let's make it a testament to our journey.

This might be the end of our tenure, but it's not the end of our journey. The bonds we've forged, the lessons we've learned, and the memories we've created will always be a part of us. The friendships we've formed, the challenges we've overcome, the successes we've celebrated, they have all prepared us for the next stages of our lives.

As we part ways, remember this, GDSC TCET is not just about the events we've held or the projects we've completed. It's about the spirit of collaboration, the pursuit of knowledge, and the bonds of friendship. It's about the difference we've made and the lives we've touched.

Let's carry this spirit forward in our individual journeys. Let's continue to learn, grow, and strive for excellence. And no matter where we find ourselves in the future, let's always remember the time we spent together, the impact we made, and the family we formed.

Here's to one last hurrah, to a grand finale, to a beautiful ending of this chapter, and to the beginning of many more. Let's make tomorrow not just an event, but a beautiful memory that we will carry in our hearts forever.

With deepest affection and utmost gratitude,
Dhiraj Chauhan
Advisory, GDSC TCET

How can I integrate/deploy the ML model such that it uses minimum bandwidth & possibly is better to manage and use? I was thinking maybe as an edge function. Guide me on this.

18/07/2023, 11:04 pm - Vansh Baghel: How did we make Google forms for SE, TE with different position allowance last year for recruitments?
18/07/2023, 11:05 pm - Vansh Baghel: @919769990750 @919653296937
18/07/2023, 11:32 pm - +91 96532 96937: what do you mean?
18/07/2023, 11:49 pm - Vansh Baghel: SE are allowed to register for working committee, and te for extended core and core.
So how shall we differentiate them in Google forms?
18/07/2023, 11:50 pm - Vansh Baghel: So that se students cannot apply for any core positions
18/07/2023, 11:50 pm - Wilfred Almeida(Gdsc): Make separate forms
18/07/2023, 11:50 pm - Anam Ansari: You can differentiate based on their answer like se te
18/07/2023, 11:50 pm - Anam Ansari: Create a new section
18/07/2023, 11:50 pm - Anam Ansari: Google
18/07/2023, 11:50 pm - Wilfred Almeida(Gdsc): Use any other form provider that's let you add such logic
18/07/2023, 11:52 pm - Vansh Baghel: They could still select core being se na
18/07/2023, 11:52 pm - Vansh Baghel: Umm, I'll see to it
19/07/2023, 12:28 am - +91 96532 96937: then their problem 🤷‍♂️
19/07/2023, 12:28 am - +91 96532 96937: you will eventually do know anyways
19/07/2023, 12:29 am - +91 96532 96937: people say random shzz in job applications, that doesn’t mean you accept them
19/07/2023, 12:42 am - Vansh Baghel: Makes sense
19/07/2023, 12:43 am - Vansh Baghel: So we will not make any field marked as required for selecting the positions, and this would work
19/07/2023, 1:04 am - +91 96532 96937: you should keep the position they want to apply for but mention that SE can only choose working committee while TE will be for core
19/07/2023, 1:04 am - +91 96532 96937: based on classes show next page
19/07/2023, 1:05 am - +91 96532 96937: and if some mismatch well lead the discussion and get it over with
19/07/2023, 1:06 am - Vansh Baghel: Could we decide the next page based on their SE or TE selection?
19/07/2023, 1:18 am - +91 96532 96937: yes
19/07/2023, 1:18 am - +91 96532 96937: and yea
19/07/2023, 12:51 pm - Vansh Baghel: TE, BE students can select only one of the positions from both core and extended core.
example: One can select Advisory from core and second preference from extended core.
19/07/2023, 12:52 pm - Vansh Baghel: its fine right?
@919653296937
19/07/2023, 12:53 pm - Vansh Baghel: @919769990750
19/07/2023, 12:59 pm - Vansh Baghel: Only TE, not BE
19/07/2023, 1:24 pm - Anam Ansari: TE core
SE extended and working
19/07/2023, 1:25 pm - Vansh Baghel: SE extended?
19/07/2023, 1:25 pm - Vansh Baghel: Extended would be for TE right?
19/07/2023, 1:28 pm - Anam Ansari: Nope, this time we should include more SE only
19/07/2023, 1:30 pm - Prathik Shetty (GDSC): This message was deleted
19/07/2023, 1:30 pm - Prathik Shetty (GDSC): SE will go to TE so we will be having good members

19/07/2023, 1:31 pm - Vansh Baghel: @919769990750 what's ur reason this?
19/07/2023, 1:36 pm - Anam Ansari: To include for SE this time. Last year we couldn’t do proper recruitment as we were still setting up the structure
19/07/2023, 1:37 pm - Vansh Baghel: okay
19/07/2023, 1:39 pm - +91 96532 96937: yep, that’s the way to go
